You're locked out of your car. It seems you've dropped your keys somewhere and can't find them! Better get looking for them!

puzzle steps:
1. Locked out of your car, maybe I threw it in the bin
2. Find note in the bin, no sign of your keys
3. Note says to look behind the red car ("red") - few red cars you need to check (red herrings like a red trash can)
4. Behind red car is bloody tyre-print - follow tracks
5. Leads to bottle of ketchup (facing wall) - pickup
6. Turn around, something is visible but hidden
7. Find another note - ("you're rubbish at this")
8. Back to bin, filled with blood - keys are floating on top
9. Creepy car chases you once keys are grabbed
10. Make your way back to the car and escape
11. END
